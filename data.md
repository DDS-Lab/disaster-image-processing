1. The data used in this project was derived from the Digital Globe Open Data Program under Creative Commons 4.0 License

    a. Large tif images were downloaded from here:  https://www.digitalglobe.com/opendata/hurricane-harvey/post-event

    b. The geojson with vector damage data crowdsourced through Tomnod (TOMNOD20170915) was found here: 

      https://www.digitalglobe.com/opendata/hurricane-harvey/vector-data

      (documentation of how that was manipulated)

2. Parcel data was collected by contacting each County Appraisal District Office and can be accessed here: 

      https://github.com/DDS-Lab/disaster-image-processing/blob/master/Parcel%20Data%20for%20Affected%20Counties%20-%20Sheet1.csv

3. Data with flood maps and ground truth damages was collected from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) here:  

      https://data.femadata.com/NationalDisasters/

4. Building footprints were retrieved from Microsoft here:  

      https://github.com/Microsoft/Open-Maps/wiki/Microsoft-Building-Footprint-Release

5. Aerial imagery data was collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association:  

      https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/storms/harvey/index.html#7/28.400/-96.690

      (Include our geojson file and what weâ€™ve changed
        Manually removed data
        List of removed of bounding boxes (from An))

6. The processed data is available via the PostGIS Server:
